#The War
I can enlist _soldiers_ to an _army_.
The _front man_ of an _army_ is the _first_ enlisted soldier
* Soldiers are equiped with one weapon and have by default “bare fists” aka no weapon.
* Weapons do #amount damage
* Four types of weapons: 
    * axe(3) 
    * sword(2) 
    * spear(2)
    * bareFists(1)
    
Two soldiers fight with each other by comparing weapon damage. 
The soldier with the strongest weapon wins-> if same then attacker wins. 
Armies can engage in a war in which consecutive front men fight with each other. 
The defeated soldier is removed from the army. 

The winning army = “last man standing” formulae.
